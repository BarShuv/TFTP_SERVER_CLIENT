This project is an extended version of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server and client implemented in Java. It adheres to a thread-per-client protocol and utilizes TCP for communication.

Key features of this implementation include support for file upload, download, deletion, and directory listing. The emphasis is on facilitating multiple user interactions and broadcast functionalities, ensuring efficient and reliable file transfer operations.

By leveraging the thread-per-client protocol, the server can handle multiple client connections concurrently, enabling seamless interaction with multiple users simultaneously. The utilization of TCP ensures reliable data transmission, minimizing the risk of data loss or corruption during file transfers.

Overall, this extended version of the TFTP server and client in Java provides a robust and versatile solution for managing file transfer operations in a networked environment, catering to the needs of both individual users and larger-scale applications.
